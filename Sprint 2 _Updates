During our weekly team meetings, we conducted a comprehensive review of the project plan, confirming each team member’s tasks and roles to ensure clarity in responsibilities. 
We initiated discussions around the overall design, starting with high-level concepts and narrowing down to specific design elements.
We also established a set of short-term goals tailored to the tasks outlined for Sprint 3.
These goals focus on completing essential components of the website design, such as the layout structure, color schemes, and user interface elements, while ensuring they align with the project’s objectives and user requirements.
As we move forward, each team member will concentrate on their specific areas, with regular check-ins planned to track progress and make adjustments as needed.
